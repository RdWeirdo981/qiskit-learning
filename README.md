# qiskit-learning

My personal learning notes on Qiskit.

Lots of the content is directly from Qiskit document. My plan is to finish all the labs & games while learning theoretical quantum computing.

My learning materials includes:

- Quantum Computation and Quantum Information - Michael and Isaac

- Quantum Computing From Linear Algebra to Physical Realizations - Nakahara and Ohmi

- Qiskit documents & tutorials
